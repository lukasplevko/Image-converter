My first Ruby script ever.This script is for converting images from my camera to jpg
If you want to use it download it and place it in the next to the folder where you have those photos. 
You have to have imagemagick install

```
homebrew install imagemagick
```

And run the program with 
```
ruby image_converter.rb
```
