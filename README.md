My first Ruby script.
This script is for converting images from raw formats like .NEF to jpg.
If you want to use it download it and place it next to the folder where you have those photos. 
You have to install imagemagick first via homebrew.

```
homebrew install imagemagick
```

And run the program with 
```
ruby image_converter.rb
```
